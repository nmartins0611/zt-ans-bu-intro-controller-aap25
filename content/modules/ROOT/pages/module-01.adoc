Welcome! In this lab, we will explore the web-based user interface (web UI) of the Ansible Automation Platform's **automation controller**.

Through hands-on exercises, we will demonstrate how easy it is to use the web UI to manage and run your Ansible Playbooks. You will start by exploring the interface, creating an **Inventory** to manage servers, importing playbooks into **Projects**, adding **Job Templates** to run those playbooks, and finally, creating a **Workflow** to link them together.

== Automation Platform Overview

The **Overview** screen is the main dashboard of the automation controller. It shows a summary of your hosts, projects, and inventories, with each count being a direct link to the corresponding objects for easy access. Below the resource counts, you will find a Job Activity graph and a card-like summary of recent Jobs, Projects, and Inventories.

We will go through all of these sections in the upcoming challenges.

== Laboratory Tips

Before we begin, here are some basic tips to improve your lab experience:

. The **instructions sidebar** (where you are reading this) can be resized by dragging its border or can be completely collapsed by clicking the "Hide instructions" button at the top. This is useful if you need extra space for the main panel.
