_A guide to importing your first Ansible Playbooks into the automation controller using Projects._

---

== Lab Briefing

A **Project** is a logical collection of Ansible Playbooks. You can manage playbooks by placing them into a source code management (SCM) system supported by the automation controller, such as Git, Subversion, or even Red Hat Insights.

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

A **Project** in the automation controller is a way to import one or more Ansible Playbooks (and their related roles and content) from a directory. While the automation controller doesn't allow you to create or edit playbooks through the web UI, it uses Projects to import them from a source like a Git repository.

In this challenge, you will create your first Project, which will import a GitHub repository containing a few simple Apache playbooks.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The credentials for the automation controller are:

* *Username:* `admin`
* *Password:* `ansible123!`
====

=== Task 1: Create the Project

First, you will create a new project that points to a public Git repository.

. **Navigate to the Projects page.**
+
In the left navigation menu, go to **Automation Execution** â†’ **Projects**.

. **Create a new project.**
+
**Click** the blue **Create project** button.

. **Enter the project details.**
+
Fill out the form with the following information:
+
* **Name:** `Apache playbooks`
* **Organization:** `Default`
* **Source Control Type:** `Git`
* **Source Control URL:**
+
[source,text]

. **Save the project.**
+
Leave all other fields as they are and **click** the blue **Create project** button.

=== Task 2: Verify the Project Sync

After creating the project, the automation controller automatically initiates a sync process to download the playbooks from the Git repository.

. **Check the project status.**
+
After saving, you will be taken to the *Details* tab for the new project. **Verify** that the *Status* for your `Apache playbooks` project is green and reads **Successful**.

. **Review the sync output.**
+
**Click** on the **Successful** status text to review the output of the sync job. This will show you the details of the Git clone process.
