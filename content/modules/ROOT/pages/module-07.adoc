_A guide to importing a second repository into a new project in the automation controller._

---

== Lab Briefing

A **Project** is a logical collection of Ansible Playbooks. You can manage playbooks by placing them into a source code management (SCM) system supported by the automation controller, such as Git, Subversion, or even Red Hat Insights.

== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

You already have a Project named `Apache playbooks` from a previous challenge. In this new challenge, you will create a second project named `Additional playbooks` which will import playbooks to install other services (`extended_services.yml`), set a message of the day (`motd_facts.yml`), and create multiple users (`loop_users.yml`).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Reminder that the credentials to log in to the automation controller are:

* *Username:* `admin`
* *Password:* `ansible123!`
====

=== Task 1: Create the Second Project

First, you will create another new project that points to a different public Git repository.

. **Navigate to the Projects page.**
+
In the left navigation menu, go to **Automation Execution** → **Projects**.

. **Create a new project.**
+
**Click** the blue **Create project** button.

. **Enter the project details.**
+
Fill out the form with the following information:
+
* **Name:** `Additional playbooks`
* **Organization:** `Default`
* **Source Control Type:** `Git`
* **Source Control URL:**
+

----

. **Save the project.**
+
Leave all other fields as they are and **click** the blue **Create project** button.

=== Task 2: Verify the Project Sync

After creating the project, the automation controller automatically initiates a sync process to download the playbooks from the Git repository.

. **Check the project status.**
+
After saving, you will be taken to the *Details* page for the new project. The *Last Job Status* should initially display **Running** in blue.

. **Verify the sync was successful.**
+
After a few seconds, the status should change to **Successful** and turn green. This indicates the project has synced correctly.

. **(Alternative) View status from the Projects list.**
+
You can also verify the status by navigating back to the main **Projects** page (**Automation Execution** → **Projects**).
+
--
a. **Check** that the *Status* column for `Additional playbooks` is green and reads **Successful**.
b. **Click** on the **Successful** status text to review the output of the sync job.
