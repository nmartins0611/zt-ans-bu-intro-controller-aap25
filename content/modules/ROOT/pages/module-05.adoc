== Lab Guide: Hands-On Tasks

**Credentials** are utilized by Ansible Automation Platform for authentication when launching jobs against devices, syncing with inventory sources, or importing projects from version control.

Credentials are imported and stored encrypted within the automation controller and are not retrievable in plain text by any user. You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials without actually exposing the sensitive information to them.

There are over 20 supported credential types, ranging from tokens to user/passwords or SSH keys. Today, you will explore the **Machine** credential type, which is used to connect to servers via SSH.

[WARNING]
====
In this exercise, you are only observing. Please do not make any changes, as the credentials are pre-loaded for you.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Reminder that the credentials to log in to the automation controller are:

* *Username:* `admin`
* *Password:* `ansible123!`
====

=== Task 1: Explore the Credentials Section

First, you will navigate to the Credentials section and examine a pre-loaded credential.

. **Navigate to the Credentials page.**
+
In the left navigation menu, go to **Automation Execution** → **Infrastructure** → **Credentials**.

. **View the list of credentials.**
+
This will display a searchable list of credentials, classified by name and type.

. **Open the lab credential.**
+
**Look** for the `lab-credentials` credential, which is a *Machine* type, and **click** on its name.

. **Examine the credential details.**
+
On the *Details* tab, notice that the *SSH Private Key* field shows **Encrypted**.

. **Check credential access.**
+
**Click** the **Team Access** and **User Access** tabs to see which automation controller users and teams have permission to use this credential.

. **Check credential usage.**
+
**Click** the **Job Templates** tab. This tab shows which jobs are currently using this credential. It should be empty right now.

=== Task 2: Examine a Machine Credential

Next, you will enter the edit view for the credential to see the available fields.

. **Enter the credential edit view.**
+
Go back to the *Details* tab for `lab-credentials` and **click** the **Edit credential** button.

. **Observe the available fields.**
+
Look at the different configuration options available for a Machine credential, but *do not edit or change anything*.

. **Note the encrypted key.**
+
Notice that the *SSH Private Key* field only allows you to **Reset** the value. As mentioned before, the key is encrypted and not retrievable from the UI after it has been saved.

. **Exit the edit view.**
+
**Click** the **Cancel** button to exit without making any accidental modifications.
